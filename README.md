# Automate-Defect-Detection-Activities-On-Steel-Surfaces-By-Using-Advanced-Machine-Vision
Visual machine steel surface defect detection is an important step in the manufacturing of steel Items. Over the last two decades, various machine learning-based algorithms were used for automatic visual inspection (AVI) in order to improve the steel manufacturing process. However, still, most of the steel manufacturing industries do not show interest in adopting AVI methods in their manufacturing process due to errors involved in this approach when compared with manual inspection even though inspection time is high. Automatic steel defect detection methods could be useful in less expensive and faster quality control and feedback.

The use of advanced technology such as Deep learning (ML) has not been explicitly deployed in modeling of steel surface defect detection in steel industries to help make the production of steel more efficient; due to the challenges that come with its automatic visual inspection (AVI) machine learning approaches such as extraction of inappropriate features from the processing of image pixels.

The aim of this work was to overcome and complement the existing challenges of steel surface defect detection by taking the advantage of advanced deep learning architectures to eliminate the train inaccuracies present in the machine learning automatic visual inspection (AVI) and to help make the production of steel more efficient.
